## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 AI Diagnostic Engine
- Uses ONNX Runtime Web and Transformers.js to deliver high-performance inference directly in the browser—no server needed.

### 🔬 Medical Image & Symptom Analysis
- Supports both structured (forms) and unstructured (text, images) inputs for comprehensive analysis.

### 📊 Patient Data Visualization
- Generates charts and visual summaries using patient inputs and AI output.

### 🌐 Offline-Ready Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Thanks to Workbox and Webpack, the app runs even with no internet—ideal for rural or off-grid deployments.

### 🔒 Local & Secure
- No patient data leaves the browser unless explicitly shared. Ideal for privacy-sensitive environments.
